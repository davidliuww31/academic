abstract  ="We systematically generate a large set of random micro-particle packings over a wide range of adhesion and friction by means of adhesive contact dynamics simulation. The ensemble of generated packings covers a range of volume fractions ϕ from 0.135 ± 0.007 to 0.639 ± 0.004{,} and of coordination numbers Z from 2.11 ± 0.03 to 6.40 ± 0.06. We determine ϕ and Z at four limits (random close packing{,} random loose packing{,} adhesive close packing{,} and adhesive loose packing){,} and find a universal equation of state ϕ(Z) to describe packings with arbitrary adhesion and friction. From a mechanical equilibrium analysis{,} we determine the critical friction coefficient μf{,}c: when the friction coefficient μf is below μf{,}c{,} particles{'} rearrangements are dominated by sliding{,} otherwise they are dominated by rolling. Because of this reason{,} both ϕ(μf) and Z(μf) change sharply across μf{,}c. Finally{,} we generalize the Maxwell counting argument to micro-particle packings{,} and show that the loosest packing{,} i.e.{,} adhesive loose packing{,} satisfies the isostatic condition at Z = 2."
